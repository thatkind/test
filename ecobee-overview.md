It was around 2017 when I discovered and purchased the Ecobee 3 smart thermostat.  Some changes have been made to later versions, such as adding support for Alexa or Siri and replacing the plastic display with glass.  These were not available with Ecobee 3, but it still has most of the major core capabilities of the newer versions.  Ecobee smart thermostats offer what you would traditionally expect from a thermostat and expands on them in helpful ways!

# Temperature

Temperature is prominently displayed and easily changed from the main touch screen interface.  They use a large, easily legible font for the numbers and the presented controls for adjusting temperature are presented as circular buttons you touch and drag up or down to manually adjust the temperature.

# Modes

Three modes (heat/cool/auto)  help ensure that you are comfortable no matter how the weather outside fluctuates.  Heat mode turns on your system's heating functions.  Cool enables your system's cooling functions.  Auto mode really comes in handy when your outside weather is delivering more extreme temperature shifts and it will activate either heat or cool as needed.  Regardless of the mode you use, the thermostat always uses forecast data for your area to help maximize the efficiency of your system and ensure your home is kept within your defined temperature comfort window.  

# Schedules

Home, sleep, and away are a few basic temperature schedules provided by default.  Home is for the temperature you prefer while you are awake.  Sleep is for your desired sleeping temperature.  Away is for when your home is not occupied, and will use a your temperature settings to basically allow your system to rest more in your absence.

# Sensors

They offer portable, battery-powered SmartSensors, which may or may not be included with your model.  You can purchase these sensors separately and add up to 32.  They are intended to monitor temperature and occupancy in rooms away from your thermostat's location.  This data is used to help make sure the rooms you are in meet your temperature comfort requirements.  This can be especially helpful in a home where the thermostat is downstairs and the upstairs temperature can vary drastically for example.

# Other Settings

There are many more settings available to finely tune when and how your system operates.
